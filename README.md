![todo-list-interface](./docs/Interface.png?raw=true)

It's my very first project: a simple ToDo List that can create, delete and mark tasks as completed.\
The stack is pretty simple: ***vanilla JavaScript*** and ***CSS***.

To run the app locally you just need to clone the repo and open `index.html` file in your browser.\
